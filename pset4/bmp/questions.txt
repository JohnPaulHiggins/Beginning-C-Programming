0.  BMP: 16 million GIF: 256 JPEG: 16 million PNG: 256 trillion
1.  GIF
2.  Lossless - no information lost. Lossy - ideally, redudant or not noticeable
    information lost.
3.  JPEG.
4.  The first character is altered to indicate that the file has been deleted, 
    and the memory is marked so that the system can write over it. 
5.  Destroy the storage medium or, at a minimum, overwrite the memory and erase
    again.
6.  A header file which declares integer types, and specifies their widths.
7.  To guarantee that the system is operating with unsigned 8-bit integers,
    unsigned 32-bit integers, signed 32-bit integers, and unsigned 16-bit
    integers, respectively.
8.  8, 32, 32, 16.
9.  BM.
10. bfSize is the size of the entire file; biSize is the size of the info header
    structure.
11. The BMP is top-down DIB; the origin is the top-left corner instead of the
    bottom-left.
12. biBitCount
13. If system cannot find or access outfile.
14. Because we read in one pixel at a time.
15. We want the length of a scanline (in bytes) to be a multiple of 4; in the
    event that the width of the picture is 3 pixels, it is 9 bytes long and
    needs three bytes of padding.
    (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE) % 4)) % 4 =
    (4 - (3 * 3 % 4)) % 4 =
    (4 - (9 % 4)) % 4 =
    (4 - 1) % 4 =
    3 % 4 =
    3
16. Moves the file position indicator in file [first argument] to location
    [third argument address + second argument * bytes]
17. The current location of the file position indicator.
18. Rick Astley? Ronald Reagan?
